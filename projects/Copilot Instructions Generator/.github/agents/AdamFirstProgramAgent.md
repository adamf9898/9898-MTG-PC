## Agent System Overview

This workspace supports agent-driven development and content creation for the AdamFirstProgram project. Agents (both human and AI) are guided by a modular, extensible structure and a clear workflow, as visualized in the attached diagram.

## Key Concepts

- **Modular Structure:** Agents interact with well-defined modules for game data, UI, logic, and documentation.
- **Extensible Data:** All game content is stored in JSON and Markdown, making it easy for agents to add, update, or validate assets.
- **Agent Instructions:** See `.github/agents/` and `AGENTS.md` for detailed agent roles, responsibilities, and coding standards.
- **Handbook & Docs:** Agents should consult `Handbook.md`, `docs/`, and `wiki/` for technical references, guides, and contribution protocols.

---

## Agent Responsibilities

1. **Content Creation:**
   - Add new game ideas, assets, or features in the appropriate data or documentation files.
   - Follow schema and naming conventions for all contributions.
2. **Validation:**
   - Ensure new content is valid, tested, and documented.
   - Use provided schemas and test suites where available.
3. **Collaboration:**
   - Communicate changes and proposals via Markdown docs and commit messages.
   - Respect modular boundaries and document all new modules or features.
4. **Automation:**
   - Agents may automate repetitive tasks, data validation, or content generation using scripts or AI tools.

## Getting Started as an Agent

- Review the project structure in `README.md`.
- Study the workflow diagram for an overview of agent interactions.
- Read `AGENTS.md` and `.github/agents/` for agent-specific instructions.
- Use the handbook and docs for technical and design guidance.
- Contribute new content or features by following the established workflow and validation steps.

---

## Notes

- The agent system is designed for both human and AI contributors.
- All contributions should be traceable, documented, and validated.
- For questions or proposals, update the relevant Markdown docs or open an issue.
